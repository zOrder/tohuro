# Welcome to KMPStarterOS, a minimalist but yet useful open source version of [AppKickstarter](https://appkickstarter.com)

If you just need to support android and ios with no backend requirement 
(just offline data) and no need for in app purchases or fancy features 
like auth and onboarding then you are on the right place and this open source template is good for you.

Otherwise, if you need more capabilities please check out our premium template [AppKickstarter](https://appkickstarter.com) which is on the same stack but with a lot more of content.
